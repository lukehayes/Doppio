# Doppio

Doppio is a small utility pack of styles to help with building MVPs. It has been designed to be
dropped into a project and that is all that is needed. The styles *mostly* apply to raw HTML
elements but additional CSS classes are also provided if they might be needed.

Minimal grey scale styles are primarily used with an optional accent color for links, buttons
and similar.

### Dependencies

* Dart-Sass

### Usage

* Clone the project
* Compile using *Dart-Sass*
* Add to page using a <link> tag

* Done
